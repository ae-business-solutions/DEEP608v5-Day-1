# 2. Accounts & Tools
### a. Accounts
You will need several accounts to complete the lab.

### c. Sign VS Code into GitHub
 - [ ] Open VS Code
 - [ ] Select the GitHub Extension (GitHub icon [Octocat] on the left of the window)
 - [ ] Hit the *Sign In* button and follow the prompts

### d. Clone the Template Repo
 - [ ] Go to https://github.com/ae-business-solutions/DEEP608v5-Day-1
 - [ ] Press the `Use this template` button
 - [ ] Fill in a name and description for your repository
	* *Reminder: you should create the repo in your personal account (not your organization if you have one; this can be selected in the drop down menu in front of the repo name)*
 - [ ] Review the contents of the template repository

### e. Local Development Setup
 - [ ] Open VS Code
 - [ ] Press Ctrl+Shift+P; you should see a text field pop up at the top of VS Code
 - [ ] Type 'Git' and select 'Git: Clone' from the dropdown
 - [ ] Select 'Clone from GitHub from the dropdown
 - [ ] Select the repository that you created in the last section from the dropdown
 - [ ] You will be prompted to choose a location to store the repo files
 - [ ] A prompt will appear at the bottom right of VS Code asking you whether you want to open this repository in the current window (choose this one) or a new window
 - [ ] If you select the files tab (the top tab) on the left of VS Code you should see the repository files; you can click any file to open it in the editor on the right
 - [ ] Take a minute to explore the VS Code UI and the repository you just cloned

 ### f. Get your GCP Service Account
 We will need a GCP Service Account to give GitHub and Terraform Cloud access to your GCP environment.

- [ ] Log into your GCP account.
- [ ] You may need to select your GCP Project from the `Project Picker` at the top of the screen (immediately to the right of the `Google Cloud Platform` logo). With the `Project Picker` open, select the `ALL` tab and then click on your Lab Id.
- [ ] Go to the `IAM & Admin` page (use the hamburger menu at the top left). Once there you will see a "devops@" account listed on the IAM tab; this is your service account.
- [ ] Go to the `Service Accounts` tab.
- [ ] Click the `...` next to the DevOps account and select `Manage Keys`.
- [ ] Chose `Add Key` and then `Create new key`. Select the `JSON` option and hit create.
- [ ] You will see a .json file download. Open this file in your text editor of choice.
- [ ] Be careful with this step! Carefully remove all newlines from the JSON file. Don't delete any text, but when you are done you should have all the JSON on a single line.
- [ ] Set this aside for the next chapter! We will refer to this as your GCP Service Account Key from here on out.
